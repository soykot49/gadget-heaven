## About the Project

GadgetHeaven is an e-commerce platform dedicated to gadget enthusiasts. This platform allows users to browse through various gadget categories, add items to their cart, create a wishlist, and easily manage their selections. It was built based on a detailed Figma design with an emphasis on a seamless and intuitive user experience.

## Features

1. **Structured Navigation and Active Route Indication**: Includes a navigation bar with logo, brand name, and menu items (Dashboard, Stats).
2. **Product Categorization and Filtering**: Sidebar with categories such as computers, phones, smartwatches, chargers, and power banks.
3. **Shopping Cart and Wishlist Management**: Add items to cart and wishlist, with Context API and LocalStorage used for data persistence.
4. **Product Sorting and Filtering**: Allows users to sort items in the cart by price, as well as filter items by category.
5. **Edge Case Handling**: Limitations on cart total, with safeguards against reloading errors and duplicate wishlist entries.
